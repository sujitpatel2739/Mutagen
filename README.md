# Mutagen
Mutagen is a Genex language-nano-language compiler powered by genetic-evolution algorithm. It mutates, refines, and repairs broken code using evolutionary strategies, transforming faulty programs into working ones. A minimal syntax, a custom lexer–parser, and a GA-driven core make it a living, self-adapting compilation system.
